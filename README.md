### 4 types of pins
- Private (default)
  - Visible to owner only
- Public
  - Visible to all after visibility decision is made 
- Promo
  - Payment is required
  - Content should be authentic, tasteful and original
- Original/Exclusive (gatekeeping?)


### Voting
- A visibility decision is made after at least max([5], [5]% of hourly active users) votes
- Each current user is asked to vote with probably p where p is proportional to the user's voting power for the pin
- A user can refuse / ignore a voting request (e.g. due to the irrelevancy of the pin to them)
- New vote requests are sent to other users if not enough votes are received within [30] minutes of the pin's creation
- After visibility decision is made, a further max([100], [10]% of daily active users) votes are collected to determine the final ranking of the link  


### User voting power
- A function of
  - the user's track record ("agreeability") from past voting and public pins (upvotes vs. down)
  - the pin's relevancy to the user


### Top pins reward
- Public pins between 24 and 48 hours old are ranked daily based on number of upvotes received
- The reward is shared between the owner of the top [10] pins in the ranking
- Original/exclusive pins
